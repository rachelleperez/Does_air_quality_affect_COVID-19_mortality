    "# Does Air Quality affect COVID-19 Mortality?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "*As of January 10th, 2021*\n",

    "**What is COVID-19? How does it spread?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Coronavirus Disease 19 (\"COVID-19\") is a contagious disease first discovered in Wuhan, China on December 2019. Within a month, the first case outside the country was discovered in Thailand and later the United States (January 21). Rapid spread including significant increases in disease-related hospitalizations and deaths continued while the public, government, and the health care communities scrambed to respond to what was then (and still is) an unknown disease. On March 10th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 **a global pandemic** ([Source](https://www.who.int/news/item/27-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other known [coronaviruses](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html) which typically cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illness, COVID-19 can cause severe illness and even death ([Source](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/immune-cells-common-cold-may-recognize-sars-cov-2#:~:text=Coronaviruses%20usually%20cause%20mild%20to,illness%20and%20even%20death.)). As per The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), COVID-19 [\"spreads through **respiratory droplets or small particles**, such as those in aerosols, produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. These particles can be **inhaled into the nose, mouth, airways, and lungs and cause infection**.\"](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#Basics). Treatment against the disease is still in development with many theories including herd immunity considered and later disproven along the way. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved one experimental drug (Remdesevir) to treat  existing patients and taken the extreme measure of allowing healthcare providers (under certain conditions) to use products not yet approved ([Source](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/treatments-for-severe-illness.html)). On the preventative side, government has implemented public measures to decrease **community spread** including lockdowns and mask mandates. Meanwhile, vaccine efforts were accelerated due to government action across the world including the U.S. [Operation Warp Speed](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/explaining-operation-warp-speed/index.html). The first U.S. COVID-19 vaccine, outside clinical trials, was administered on December 2020 (only a year after the disease was first heard of) and national distribution efforts are under way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Who has an increased risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19 (in the United States)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As [per the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#Basics), the following people have an increased risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19:\n",
    "* Older adults\n",
    "* People of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions\n",
    "* Pregnant people are also at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDC also [states](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#Basics): **\"Long-standing systemic health and social inequities have put many people from racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19.\"** This inequality is most evident in the rate of deaths. A black (or African American) and Hispanic (or Latino) person is 2.8X more likely to die from COVID-19 than a White (Non-Hispanic) person. An American Indian (or Alaska Native) is 2.6X more likely ([Source](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**PROBLEM: Given that COVID-19 is transmmitted via respiratory particles and the unfair inqequalities in its mortality rate, can something be done to prevent or decrease its effects?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Since before COVID-19's discovery, there has been public debate related to the existence and actions to take against climate change (particularly air pollution). Air pollution was heavily politized through the 2015 passage (and 2017 repeal) of the [Clean Power Plan](https://archive.epa.gov/epa/cleanpowerplan/fact-sheet-overview-clean-power-plan.html) aimed at reducing carbon pollution from power plants and the 2019 introduction of the [Green New Deal](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hres109/BILLS-116hres109ih.pdf) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the country faces a devastating disease which spreads through air particles and the government considers climate change legislation, it is crucial to consider: **Does air quality affect Covid-19 mortality?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As the timeline and implementation of disease mitigation efforts differs widely between states, a look at one state where all counties have the same legislation (for the most part) is more meaningful. This project will look at **New York State** whose regions display a wide range of conditions that may affect air quality such as population density, racial makeup, income level, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective: \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: **Does air quality affect COVID-19 mortality in New York State?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, this project will compare the following data per county:\n",
    "* COVID-19 Deaths\n",
    "* Air Quality\n",
    "* Demographics\n",

    "Air Quality can be framed based on levels of different pollutants. \n",
    "\n",
    "The United Stated Environment Protection Agency (EPA) publishes [outdoor air quality data daily](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data) on the following pollutants:\n",
    "* Carbon Monoxide (CO)\n",

    "\n",
    "The scope of our project will focus on a particular region. Assuming we go with New York State, we should base our metric of air quality on what that state does. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) publishes air quality data on its [website](https://www.dec.ny.gov/cfmx/extapps/aqi/aqi_forecast.cfm) based on \"Fine Particles\", **Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5)**.\n"

    "**What is Particulate Matter?** According to the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics), particulate matter (PM) refers to \"a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air\" and hence inhalable. PM10 are generally 10 micrometers (and smaller) and PM 2.5 referred to as \"fine particles\" are generally around 2.5 micrometers. To put into perspective, the average human hair is 70 micrometers in diameter (30 times larger than PM 2.5). These particles can be made up of hundreds of different chemicals but the most worrisome part is that they are inhaled and can cause serious health problems. \"Some particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter can get deep into your lungs and some may even get into your bloodstream.\" A summary of health and environmental effects of particular matter can he found [HERE](https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm).\n",
    "\n",
    "PM 2.5 is measured in micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3). The EPA has set the annual PM 2.5 standard to 12 ug/m3 [Source](https://www3.epa.gov/region1/airquality/pm-aq-standards.html). NY DEC (and the EPA) usually reports an **Air Quality Index (AQI)** instead of the individual units.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**What is AQI?** The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a scale from 0 to 500 that provides an indicator of the quality of air and its health effects. 101 typically corresponds to the level that starts being \"unhealthy for sensitive groups\". It can be based on the amount of PM2.5 found in the air. \n",
    "\n",

A crucial finding is that **air quality variables have a stronger correlation with covid deaths per capita than population density** which defies the expected based on what the public has been informed."
